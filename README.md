# Steller-sea-lion-Biomass-Model-2023

Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) consumption of ocean age-0 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) along the northwest coast of Washington State

Lewis et al. 2023


This GitHub page includes all of the necessary data inputs, parameters and corresponding code to replicate the ‘zoib’ and biomass modeling referenced in the Lewis et al. manuscript. 

The modeling process is notated in order, starting at “1-Chinook proportion ZOIB model.Rmd”. 
All .Rmd files have a corresponding html folder which walks through the coding steps and data manipulation. 

This GitHub is uploaded as if the code has already been ran for the model, thus the model outputs and data sheets reflect the outputs reported in the manuscript. 
*NOTE* if you rerun any of the code, the outputs will be replaced, and the results will differ slightly from the reported values due to the MCMC replication process. 

For any questions regarding the biomass modeling process, please contact the corresponding author Zoë Lewis (zoel@lummi-nsn.gov) for additional guidance.
